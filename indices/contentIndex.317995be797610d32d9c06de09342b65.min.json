Each page of this website is called a **note.** \n\nNotes are written in a language that is called [[notes/Markdown|Markdown]]. Markdown is a *markup language*, which is just a fancy way to say \"make my text pretty\". \n\n\u003e [!INFO]\n\u003e For a more indepth guide to Markdown, check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).\n\nYou use Markdown to put together a document, and simply save the file as a `note_name.md`.\n\nOnce a note is put together, you can ping me (@0x3C#0001) in the [[notes/TM Skinning Discord|TM Skinning Discord]], and I will work with you to get it published.\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-07T22:27:31.901838676Z","tags":null},"/notes/Markdown":{"title":"Markdown","content":"\nIt doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write just about anything. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.\n\nYou can write `.markdown`/`.md` files just like a `.txt` file in Notepad. You can also look into applications specifically for writing and editing Markdown files. \n\nSome good Markdown editors include:\n-   [Obsidian](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/) is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded with features.\n\t- I use this one personally! It integrates really well with the publishing workflow for the wiki.\n-   [Simplenote](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/simplenote/) is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.\n-   [Notable](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/notable/) is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms.\n-   [Joplin](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/joplin/) is a note taking application that respects your privacy. It’s available for every platform.\n\nThe best way to learn is to simply get started! \n\nOpen up The Markdown Guide, and head on down to [Kicking The Tires](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#kicking-the-tires). The guide recommends using Dillinger, however I personally recommend jumping in with Obsidian, head first. I'm using it personally to write the wiki, as well as my own personal notes and a dozen other projects.
