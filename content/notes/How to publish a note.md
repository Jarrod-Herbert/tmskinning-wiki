# How to publish a note

First things first! Each page of this website is called a **note.** 

Notes are written in a language that is called [[notes/Markdown|Markdown]]. Markdown is a *markup language*, which is just a fancy way to say "make my text pretty".

> For a more indepth guide to Markdown, check out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/).

You use Markdown to put together a document, and simply save the file as a `note_name.md`.

Once a note is put together, you can ping me (@0x3C#0001) in the [[notes/TM Skinning Discord|TM Skinning Discord]], and I will work with you to get it published.
