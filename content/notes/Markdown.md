It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know how to use it, you can write just about anything. Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery lists.

You can write `.markdown`/`.md` files just like a `.txt` file in Notepad. You can also look into applications specifically for writing and editing Markdown files. 

Some good Markdown editors include:
-   [Obsidian](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/obsidian/) is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded with features.
	- I use this one personally! It integrates really well with the publishing workflow for the wiki.
-   [Simplenote](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/simplenote/) is a free, barebones note-taking application available for every platform.
-   [Notable](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/notable/) is a note-taking application that runs on a variety of platforms.
-   [Joplin](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/joplin/) is a note taking application that respects your privacy. It’s available for every platform.

The best way to learn is to simply get started! 

Open up The Markdown Guide, and head on down to [Kicking The Tires](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#kicking-the-tires). The guide recommends using Dillinger, however I personally recommend jumping in with Obsidian, head first. I'm using it personally to write the wiki, as well as my own personal notes and a dozen other projects. Completely free, no account required.
